# toDoList
<h1>A To-do list web application</h1>

<p>I am working on this project to develop a To-do list application using Node.js, Express, MongoDB and other related technology. It can surely improve the user's productivity and leads to a better lifestyle.</p>
<p>I plan to release it on web side first. If I got extra time I would move it to mobile side.</p>
<p> Anyone interested in this project please feel free to fork.</p>
